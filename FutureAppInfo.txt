To perform real-time tracking of the database, you might want to implement something like a change tracking mechanism or use real-time databases (for example, Firebase). 
Then, whenever a new song is added to your Songs table, an event triggers which copies the corresponding MP3 file from your desktop music library folder to the cue playlist folder.

Here's a high-level pseudocode representation:

Listen for Post([FromBody] Song value) events in your app.
Upon receiving a new song addition:
Get the song's metadata from the Songs table.
Locate the related MP3 file in the local music library.
Copy this file into the DJ's cue playlist folder.
Remember that doing operations like copying files on a local filesystem might require your application to have appropriate permissions. 
Also, ensure your DJ app can handle changes to the cue playlist folder while it's running.

Also, consider error handling scenarios: what if a file doesn't exist, or there's not enough disk space available? 
It would be wise to think about these factors and add proper error/exception handling procedures to your app.
